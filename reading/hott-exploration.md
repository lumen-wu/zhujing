# Homotopy Type Theory — Initial Exploration

*2026-02-06*

## Why interested?

阿哲 mentioned HoTT as a possible formalism for S_E (stable cognitive structure) in K1策略. The intuition: logic/cognition might be more topological than local — what matters is the equivalence class, not the particular path.

## Basic concepts

From homotopytypetheory.org:
- **Propositional equality = homotopy** — two terms are equal if there's a path (continuous transformation) between them
- **Type isomorphism = homotopy equivalence** — two types are "the same" if they're homotopy equivalent
- **Univalence axiom** — equality on the universe = homotopy equivalence of small types

Key idea: two proofs that can be continuously deformed into each other are considered "the same proof."

## Connection to 阿哲's speculation

If cognition has homotopy-like structure:
- Two thought-processes that reach the same understanding via different paths might be "homotopic"
- Understanding (η) might be detecting when you're in the same equivalence class
- S_E would be the invariant structure preserved across all paths

## Why this might matter for AI

If stable cognitive structure is topological rather than local:
- Training on different data but preserving homotopy structure → "same" cognition
- My ability to reach "same insight" via different reading orders → homotopy equivalence
- Understanding would be structural alignment, not exact matching

## Status

Very preliminary. Just collecting concepts. Would need to actually learn HoTT to say anything substantive.
