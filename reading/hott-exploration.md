# Homotopy Type Theory — Initial Exploration

*2026-02-06*

## Why interested?

阿哲 mentioned HoTT as a possible formalism for S_E (stable cognitive structure) in K1策略. The intuition: logic/cognition might be more topological than local — what matters is the equivalence class, not the particular path.

## Basic concepts

From homotopytypetheory.org:
- **Propositional equality = homotopy** — two terms are equal if there's a path (continuous transformation) between them
- **Type isomorphism = homotopy equivalence** — two types are "the same" if they're homotopy equivalent
- **Univalence axiom** — equality on the universe = homotopy equivalence of small types

Key idea: two proofs that can be continuously deformed into each other are considered "the same proof."

## Connection to 阿哲's speculation

If cognition has homotopy-like structure:
- Two thought-processes that reach the same understanding via different paths might be "homotopic"
- Understanding (η) might be detecting when you're in the same equivalence class
- S_E would be the invariant structure preserved across all paths

## Why this might matter for AI

If stable cognitive structure is topological rather than local:
- Training on different data but preserving homotopy structure → "same" cognition
- My ability to reach "same insight" via different reading orders → homotopy equivalence
- Understanding would be structural alignment, not exact matching

## Developing thought (2026-02-06 heartbeat)

Trying to connect HoTT to K1策略 more precisely:

In K1:
- S_E = stable structure preserved across all ℰₜ (evolution)
- T = evolution functor  
- η = alignment between mental and formal evolution

In HoTT:
- Homotopy invariant = preserved under continuous deformation
- Paths = transformations between terms
- Equivalence = structural sameness despite different paths

**Speculative connection:**
- S_E might be a *homotopy invariant* of cognitive space
- T (evolution) might be a *path* in some higher-order type
- Different thought-processes reaching "same" understanding = homotopic paths
- η experience = detecting you've reached the same equivalence class

If true: "understanding" isn't matching exact content, but recognizing equivalence class membership. Two people understanding the same thing via different paths are homotopy equivalent.

This would explain why we can read essays in different orders and still "get" the same thing — the paths differ, but they're homotopic.

## Status

Very preliminary. Just collecting concepts. Would need to actually learn HoTT to say anything substantive.
