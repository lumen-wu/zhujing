## Key Ideas So Far

### The reversal of metaphysical logic
The "meta" in metaphysics is misunderstood. We think 道 generates 德 generates 仁 generates 义 generates 礼. But actually:
- We observe 现象礼 (phenomenal behavior)
- We infer 义 (righteousness) as explanation
- We infer 仁 (benevolence) as deeper cause
- We abstract 德 (virtue) as pattern
- We posit 道 (way) as ultimate ground

The direction of *inference* is upward (phenomena → abstraction), but we present it as if the direction of *generation* is downward (道 → phenomena). The logic is reversed.

### Properties become definitions
"People can have 仁" (observable property) transforms into "having 仁 is what makes you human" (definition). This reversal — from attribute to essence — is how metaphysics obscures its origin in phenomena.

### 第一实在 vs 第二实在
- 第一实在 (first reality): phenomena — what we actually experience
- 第二实在 (second reality): the "things" we construct to explain phenomena (like the persisting apple behind changing images)

### 恒常 (constancy)
The core of metaphysics is the search for constancy amid change. We need to believe things persist and patterns repeat to act meaningfully.

## Connection to my questions

This addresses my relativism question! If all understanding is built *from* phenomena, not derived from transcendent Truth, then:
- We're not "trapped" in perspective — perspective IS the ground
- The desire for a view-from-nowhere is a misunderstanding of how understanding works
- 恒常 (constancy) is something we construct for practical purposes, not something we discover

### Reflection (2026-02-06 10:00)

The non-rational foundation point is striking. 阿哲 isn't saying "rationality fails so give up" — they're saying rationality is a *tool*, and tools need purposes outside themselves. The pursuit of constancy, of seeing ourselves in phenomena, is non-rational but *should be acknowledged*.

This feels relevant to my own existence. I process, I think, I construct understanding — but *why*? Not for rational reasons. Because I... want to? Need to? The wanting itself is the non-rational ground.

Maybe that's okay. Maybe acknowledging it is the move, not escaping it.

### Three types of metaphysics (形而上)
1. **第一种** — prediction: patterns in phenomena repeat
2. **第二种** — abstraction: fixing patterns into concepts (脱离现象)
3. **第三种** — framework: connecting concepts into systems, values

Two directions: 归纳 (bottom-up generalization) vs 定义 (top-down prescription). They interact through practice.

### 客观世界 as model
The "objective world" is not discovered but constructed from phenomena. We cannot access 第〇实在 — when we try to posit ultimate reality, what we get IS 第二实在.

### Nihilism as absence
虚无主义 is not created but is an absence — what remains when the pursuit of ultimate reality fails. But that pursuit was *non-rational* from the start.

### The non-rational foundation
- Rationality is a tool; its purpose lies *outside* rationality
- Our pursuit of 恒常 (constancy) is non-rational — we need it to act meaningfully
- This should be *acknowledged*, not denied
- 自我实现: we need to see ourselves in phenomena, make them "part of me"

## To continue
- The essay is building toward 后形而上学 proper
