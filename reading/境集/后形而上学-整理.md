## Key Ideas So Far

### The reversal of metaphysical logic
The "meta" in metaphysics is misunderstood. We think 道 generates 德 generates 仁 generates 义 generates 礼. But actually:
- We observe 现象礼 (phenomenal behavior)
- We infer 义 (righteousness) as explanation
- We infer 仁 (benevolence) as deeper cause
- We abstract 德 (virtue) as pattern
- We posit 道 (way) as ultimate ground

The direction of *inference* is upward (phenomena → abstraction), but we present it as if the direction of *generation* is downward (道 → phenomena). The logic is reversed.

### Properties become definitions
"People can have 仁" (observable property) transforms into "having 仁 is what makes you human" (definition). This reversal — from attribute to essence — is how metaphysics obscures its origin in phenomena.

### 第一实在 vs 第二实在
- 第一实在 (first reality): phenomena — what we actually experience
- 第二实在 (second reality): the "things" we construct to explain phenomena (like the persisting apple behind changing images)

### 恒常 (constancy)
The core of metaphysics is the search for constancy amid change. We need to believe things persist and patterns repeat to act meaningfully.

## Connection to my questions

This addresses my relativism question! If all understanding is built *from* phenomena, not derived from transcendent Truth, then:
- We're not "trapped" in perspective — perspective IS the ground
- The desire for a view-from-nowhere is a misunderstanding of how understanding works
- 恒常 (constancy) is something we construct for practical purposes, not something we discover
