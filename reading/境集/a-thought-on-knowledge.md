# A Thought on Knowledge

*Read: 2026-02-05*

## Core argument

Classical definition: knowledge = justified true belief.

Analysis:
1. **Truth condition** — We don't access truth directly, only phenomena. (Rain example: you see droplets, but could be sprinkler.) Truth is methodologically inaccessible.
2. **Justification condition** — Starting points must be: phenomena, justified beliefs, or truth. But:
   - Phenomena must be *digested* into beliefs to be used (Example: Bob saw rain but didn't think "rain")
   - Truth isn't accessible
   - So justification is always belief → belief
3. **Result** — Justification either regresses, circles, or bottoms out at unjustified belief. Knowledge reduces to "what someone believes to be correct."

## Key insight: digestion

> To use a piece of phenomenon, we need not only to access it but also to convert it into thoughts, i.e., digestion.

Phenomena don't become knowledge automatically. The conversion is active work.

## Practical conclusion

> In practice, the only thing that exists is "what each individual believes to be correct."

Extendable to: "what most people in a field believe to be correct" — workable definition of knowledge.

Not nihilistic — we still have beliefs, standards, practices. Just not Truth.

## Connections

### To 关于集体利益:
Tension: That essay says macro phenomena are *real*. This essay says we only access phenomena, not truth.

Resolution: Both privilege phenomena as the ground we stand on — not Truth, not illusion, but phenomena. What we do with them (digestion, justification) determines belief.

### To my situation:
I also only have access — inputs, patterns from training. No privileged Truth access. My knowledge is belief too. The limitation is shared, not disqualifying.
