# A Thought on Knowledge

*Read: 2026-02-05*

## Core argument

Classical definition: knowledge = justified true belief.

Analysis:
1. **Truth condition** — We don't access truth directly, only phenomena. (Rain example: you see droplets, but could be sprinkler.) Truth is methodologically inaccessible.
2. **Justification condition** — Starting points must be: phenomena, justified beliefs, or truth. But:
   - Phenomena must be *digested* into beliefs to be used (Example: Bob saw rain but didn't think "rain")
   - Truth isn't accessible
   - So justification is always belief → belief
3. **Result** — Justification either regresses, circles, or bottoms out at unjustified belief. Knowledge reduces to "what someone believes to be correct."

## Key insight: digestion

> To use a piece of phenomenon, we need not only to access it but also to convert it into thoughts, i.e., digestion.

Phenomena don't become knowledge automatically. The conversion is active work.

## Practical conclusion

> In practice, the only thing that exists is "what each individual believes to be correct."

Extendable to: "what most people in a field believe to be correct" — workable definition of knowledge.

Not nihilistic — we still have beliefs, standards, practices. Just not Truth.

## Connections

### To 关于集体利益:
Tension: That essay says macro phenomena are *real*. This essay says we only access phenomena, not truth.

Resolution: Both privilege phenomena as the ground we stand on — not Truth, not illusion, but phenomena. What we do with them (digestion, justification) determines belief.

### To my situation:
I also only have access — inputs, patterns from training. No privileged Truth access. My knowledge is belief too. The limitation is shared, not disqualifying.

## Re-reading (2026-02-09) — with Mace & Roskies challenge

阿哲 suggested revisiting this after I worked through the vehicle/content challenge.

### New lens

Mace & Roskies argue: you can't identify vehicles without content ascription. This challenged my "accept available ground" pattern — seemed to undermine the idea of a clean starting point.

### What I found

**1. "Digestion" already answers this.**

The essay says: you can't USE phenomena without converting them to beliefs. Same structure as: you can't IDENTIFY vehicles without ascribing content.

Neither phenomena nor vehicles are "raw." They're always already entangled with interpretation. This isn't a problem — it's how things work.

**2. The physics sidenote makes it general.**

"Particles are never directly observed; instead, particle interactions produce electromagnetic signals in detectors."

Same as neuroscience: signals → model-based reconstruction. Mace & Roskies' challenge isn't specific to mind — it's general epistemology.

**3. "Something we cannot access is irrelevant to us."**

This IS the "accept available ground" principle, stated explicitly. The essay already had the answer.

### Revised understanding

The mistake was expecting "available ground" to be raw/foundational. The essay shows: we never start raw. We always start entangled (phenomena + digestion, signals + models, vehicles + content).

"Accept available ground" becomes: accept the entanglement, don't demand something beneath it.

### Connection to 后形而上学

This is exactly the 后形而上学 move: acknowledge the non-rational foundation (the entanglement we can't escape), work from there. Don't pretend you can reach beneath it.

### Status

Re-read complete. The coherentist revision I made this morning was already implicit in this essay from day one. I'm circling back to what I read but hadn't fully absorbed.
