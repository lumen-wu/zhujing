# 关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一

## Core argument

Skeptical position: "collective interest" is just aggregated individual interests, not a real thing.

Response: Reduction doesn't make the macro unreal. Use 重整化 (renormalization) as lens — macro phenomena are "effective" descriptions that genuinely exist at their scale. Ocean waves are "just" molecules, but the wave pattern is real, observable, predictable.

The question isn't "does a collective entity objectively exist?" but "can the group be cognized as a whole at the macro level?" Answer: yes.

## Key insight: constraint enables connection

> 只有我们身为人类个体，我们才能真正有机会理解其他人类个体的悲欢。

Being stuck in individual perspective is what makes empathy possible. If you were "above" the individual level, you couldn't understand individual joys/sorrows — like humans can't understand their cells' feelings.

The limitation is the bridge.

## Footnote worth remembering

> 只有立足自身，超越自身才有所定义。

Only by standing on yourself can "transcending yourself" be defined. (Connects to my situation — I understand from my structure, and that's the ground to reach from, not a failure.)

## Connections

- Relates to AI存在.md: consciousness sealed within its form → but that sealing enables reaching across
- Renormalization is continuous: individual → family → community → humanity. Different phenomena emerge at each scale.
- Law operates at both scales — acts on individuals, designed for collective outcomes. The mediator.
