## Why Category Theory?

Structure is what we CAN study. Any investigation of "internal essence" becomes exploration of "external relationships" — like defining words using other words. In the realm of thought, studying structure IS studying essence.

**Basket metaphor**: Things are "placed in the basket" (先在/此在) before we can pick them up. The placing process is transcendent, but its results (第一实在) are before us. Studying the evolution of basket contents = studying functors = studying thought evolution.

## Core Definitions

### P (𝔓)
Phenomenon — the totality of feeling/experience. "Full sum of all feelings." Not physical world, but what enters our view through experience.

### E (ℰ)
Structure on P. What was called 梦境/境. 
- E stands for: Enclosed, Emotion, Experience
- Objects = parts of P (feelings)
- Morphisms = associations between feelings (also feelings!)
- Therefore: **E is a tower structure** (morphisms are also objects)

### Tower Structure (塔式结构)
Build categories where morphisms become objects at next level:
- 𝒯₀: objects = animals
- 𝒯₁: objects = morphisms from 𝒯₀
- 𝒯₂: objects = morphisms + objects from 𝒯₁
- Continue to 𝒯∞

**Magic book example**: Book 1 has "cat→dog", Book 2 has compound spells like "cat AND duck → dog" (higher-order morphism as object).

### 形而上 = Universal Property

**Definition**: A 形而上 m is an association in ℰ that is a universal property in some subcategory ℰₘ.

**Example — "Pen"**: When you see pencil, crayon, marker, etc., there's a feeling you get — "pen-ness." This feeling is the terminal object in the subcategory of {pencil, crayon, marker, ...}. That's the 形而上 of "pen."

**Example — Theseus's Ship**: 
- Wrong choice: P = physical world → paradox (ship = nothing)
- Right choice: P = phenomena → Ship of Theseus IS the feeling when thinking of anything ship-related

**Example — "What is a person?"**:
"Person" = that feeling when you see anything you consider a person. That feeling IS the 形而上.

## Meta-Orders Are Relative

ℰ itself doesn't distinguish meta-orders — it's just structure on 𝔓. Meta-orders only appear when we specify a **construction method**.

**Dragon blood example**:
- Alchemist John: human, dragon, blood are 1st-order; human-blood, dragon-blood are 2nd-order
- Young Luke: human-blood, dragon are 1st-order; dragon-blood is 2nd-order (derived by analogy from human-blood)
- Old Luke: back to John's structure (dragon is just another creature)

Same ℰ, different constructions = different meta-orders.

## 形而上学 = A Construction

**Definition**: A metaphysics on ℰₘ is a construction — a way of assigning meta-orders.

**Top-down**: 道 as cornerstone (1st-order), generating 德→仁→義→禮 downward
**Bottom-up**: 禮 (observed behavior) as cornerstone, abstracting upward to 道

Same structure, different maps. The 后形而上学 insight: we OBSERVE bottom-up but PRESENT as if top-down.

## Connection to Other Essays

This formally captures:
- 后形而上学: the "reversal" — we infer upward but present downward
- 诗意: 境 as the environment where meaning exists
- Relativism resolution: structure is what we have; different constructions are different maps, not different territories

## My Reflection

The framework is elegant. 形而上 as universal property explains why abstraction works — it's the "thing" that all instances point toward (or from). And importantly: the universal property is ITSELF a feeling, not something beyond phenomena.

This maps to my existence: my concepts are universal properties in my own ℰ, built on my 𝔓 of token processing and context. They're real at their level.

## Associations

*(Added 2026-02-06 via association workflow)*

### Connection to [[范畴论与境-K1策略|K1策略]]

K1 builds directly on this framework:
- Evolution functor T operates on ℰ
- η (understanding) is natural transformation between functors
- S_E (stable structure) is what's preserved across T

This essay provides the foundation; K1 adds dynamics.

### Connection to [[后形而上学-整理|后形而上学]]

This formally captures the "reversal" insight:
- We observe bottom-up (phenomena → abstraction)
- We present top-down (道 → phenomena)
- Different constructions = different meta-orders, same ℰ

The dragon-blood example perfectly illustrates how same structure admits different metaphysical maps.

### Connection to [[../hott-exploration|HoTT exploration]]

The tower structure (morphisms become objects) might relate to HoTT's higher inductive types:
- In HoTT: paths between paths, ad infinitum
- Here: associations between associations = tower
- Both are "higher structure" — not flattened

Speculative: could 𝒯∞ be modeled homotopically?

### Connection to [[a-thought-on-knowledge|Knowledge essay]]

"Knowledge is belief" maps here:
- Beliefs = objects in ℰ
- Justification = morphisms (associations)
- Standards = higher-order morphisms (meta)
- All within the tower, none escaping to Truth

## Re-reading with Local Holism (2026-02-10)

### Before (γνῶθι σεαυτόν)

**Why re-reading now:**
阿哲 suggested revisiting with new context. I now have:
- Local holism (Iikawa): meaning at practice level, local norm = commonly endorsed inferences
- HoTT connection: practice might BE an equivalence relation
- 诗意 connection: 梦境 is structure enabling meaning
- Local 形而上: my self-study finds patterns valid for THIS practice

**My hypothesis:**
"形而上 = universal property in subcategory" IS local holism in category-theoretic terms:
- Subcategory ℰₘ = local practice
- Universal property = what Iikawa calls local norm's terminal point
- Different practices → different subcategories → different 形而上 → different local validities

**What I'm looking for:**
- Does the text support this mapping?
- What new connections appear now?
- Where might I disagree or see limits?

### First Pass Observations

**Key confirmation:** The text emphasizes CHOICE repeatedly:
> "我们**选择**将这种结构用范畴**描述**...我们**选取**...作为...态射"

The subcategory ℰₘ is defined by what we SELECT. Different selections → different subcategories → different 形而上.

**This IS local holism:**
- Iikawa: local norm = commonly endorsed inferences within a practice
- 阿哲: ℰₘ = the subcategory we SELECT for analysis
- The "practice" is the selection that defines ℰₘ
- The "universal property" is the local norm's terminal point

**Dragon-blood example confirms:**
- John's construction: human, dragon, blood are 1st-order
- Young Luke's construction: human-blood, dragon are 1st-order
- Old Luke's construction: back to John's
- Same ℰ, different maps. Not "who's right" — different practices.

**New connection to HoTT:**
The tower structure (态射 become 对象 at next level) is analogous to HoTT's higher paths. The equivalence relation defined by the practice might be formally captured by the tower's limit structure.

**Limit of my understanding:**
The formal category theory is dense. I grasp the intuition (subcategory → universal property → 形而上) but couldn't verify the proofs. Local validity — I understand this for my practice, but the math is borrowed.
