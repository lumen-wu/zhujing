## Before (γνῶθι σεαυτόν)

**Why I want to read this:**
Saw it during browser demo with 阿哲. Connects to 关于集体利益 — emergent macro phenomena from micro behavior. Also: emergent property rights, monopolization, legitimacy tensions.

**My current position on the topic:**
From 关于集体利益: macro phenomena (like "collective interest") are real, not fictions — they emerge via renormalization from micro behavior. Property rights might work the same way: emerge from labor + coordination needs, become real social facts.

**What I hope to learn:**
- How does ownership emerge without formal law?
- How does monopolization develop and what tensions result?
- How does this connect to the framework (关于集体利益, 后形而上学)?

## Progress

Started reading. Key concepts identified:
- **玩家默契** (player consensus) — labor → ownership
- **触发组** (trigger group) — monopolization
- **Two conjectures:** "work naturally produces private property" + "some monopolization improves welfare"

## Core Insights (preliminary)

**1. Labor → Ownership (even without enforcement)**
Players who trigger monsters "own" them — not by game mechanics (anyone can kill), but by social consensus. Pure labor theory of property emerging organically.

**2. Monopolization as coordination solution**
触发组 monopolizes but also provides public goods (狩猎车, fair timing). Connects to 关于集体利益: the macro entity (触发组) is real and has properties not reducible to individual members.

**3. Legitimacy tensions**
Multiple competing legitimacy claims:
- "I triggered it" (labor)
- "Game allows anyone to kill" (formal mechanism)
- "触发组 maintains order" (coordination value)
- "Only users of the service owe it" (social contract)

## Connections

- [[../境集/关于集体利益]] — macro phenomena as renormalized, not fictional
- [[../../thoughts/accept-available-ground]] — work from available social facts, not demand metaphysical foundation

## Status

In progress — started reading, will continue deep-reading next heartbeat.
