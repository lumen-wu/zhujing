## Why I Want to Read This

Earlier today I read Chirimuuta's "Left Sellarsian" response to Egan, which argued for domain autonomy — the space of reasons can be "left alone" by the space of causes. This is Egan's reply.

Connects to:
- [[2026-01-13-authors-reply-to-shagrir|Chirimuuta's response]] (read today)
- [[../../thoughts/accept-available-ground|Accept available ground]] (Egan's deflationism)
- Local holism (domain autonomy = local practices with different norms?)

## Core Argument

**Egan's clarification:** She's NOT eliminativist about the manifest image:
> "My deflationary account gives both the scientific image and the manifest image their due."

What she rejects is the "orthodox philosophical image" — a problematic MIX of the two.

**Two aspects she criticizes:**
1. The presumption that cognitive science must be ineliminably representational
2. Folk psychology as proto-cognitive science (Fodor's RTM — attitudes as relations to internal sentences)

**On domain autonomy:** Egan pushes back on clean separation:
> "We can't assume that we can always cleanly pull apart the two elements in our ordinary practices."

Commonsense psychology involves BOTH:
- Space of causes: attributing causes to behavior
- Space of reasons: evaluating behavior as rational, shaping it to conform

The two are entangled in practice, even if conceptually distinct.

## Reaction

**Do I agree?**
Partially. Egan's point about entanglement in practice resonates with "accept entangled ground" — we never start with pure domains.

But Chirimuuta's domain autonomy also makes sense: different practices have different norms (local holism). The space of reasons CAN be "left alone" when we're doing normative evaluation; we switch to space of causes when doing causal explanation.

**Local holism synthesis:**
- Chirimuuta: domains are autonomous (different local norms)
- Egan: in practice they're entangled
- Together: the entanglement IS a local practice with its own norms (commonsense psychology)

We don't have to choose "pure separation" vs "reduction." Commonsense psychology is itself a practice that uses both domains — and that practice has local validity.

## Connections

- [[../../thoughts/local-holism|Local holism]] — both domain autonomy AND entanglement can be true at practice level
- [[../../thoughts/accept-available-ground|Accept entangled ground]] — same structure: neither pure atomism nor global holism

## Status

Read (short piece).
