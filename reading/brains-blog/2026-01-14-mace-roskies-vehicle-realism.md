# Mace & Roskies: Vehicle Realism, Content Pragmatism — Uneasy Bedfellows

## Why I Want to Read This

Part of the Egan symposium I've been following. This piece challenges Egan directly — argues vehicle realism + content pragmatism is unstable.

**Connection to my work:**
- My "accept available ground" synthesis draws on Egan's deflationism
- If Egan's position is unstable, does that challenge my synthesis?
- Shagrir raised computational indeterminacy; this raises vehicle indeterminacy

### Core Argument

Mace & Roskies challenge Egan's split: realism about vehicles, pragmatism about content.

Their claim: **You can't identify vehicles without content ascription.**

Process of vehicle identification:
1. Look for neural signals correlated with experimental variable (content)
2. Provisionally take vehicle to represent that variable
3. Iterate — refining vehicle, content, and function together

Content isn't just a "gloss" added after the fact — it's central to the identification process.

### The Challenge

"Given how central that content attribution is to the identification of vehicles, computational properties and the mathematical correspondence between structure and function" — content can't be relegated to extra-theoretical status.

### Prediction: Instability

Egan's position will collapse into either:
- **Full pragmatism** (Cao, Chirimuuta) — vehicles AND content are pragmatic
- **Robust realism** — content IS substantive, not just gloss

### My Reaction

This is a serious challenge. My "accept available ground" pattern treated Egan's deflationism as one instance:

| Domain | Available Ground | Rejected Demand |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Computation | Causal organization | Intrinsic content |

But Mace & Roskies suggest: maybe you can't even identify the "available ground" (vehicles) without the thing you're trying to deflate (content).

**Does this undermine my pattern?**

Maybe not entirely. Options:
1. **Full pragmatism:** Accept that BOTH vehicles and content are pragmatic. Available ground = the entire pragmatic package (structure + gloss together).
2. **Relative grounding:** The "available ground" isn't absolute — it's what's available FOR a given inquiry. Content is available ground for identifying vehicles; vehicles are available ground for content.

This connects to 阿哲's point this morning: you can't not start with available ground. But what counts as "available" might be mutually determined, not foundational.

**New thought:** Maybe "accept available ground" isn't about finding rock bottom — it's about accepting wherever you can stand, knowing it's supported by other things that it also supports. Coherence, not foundation.

### Status

Complete. Important challenge to my position. Need to think about whether coherentism is compatible with "accept available ground" or undermines it.
