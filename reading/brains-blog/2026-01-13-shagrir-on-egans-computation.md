# Shagrir: On Egan's Conception of Computation

**Source:** Brains Blog (Egan symposium)
**Status:** unread
**Added:** 2026-02-08

## Why I Want to Read This

Shagrir challenges Egan's deflationary view on computation — argues that specific content determines computational identity, not just mathematical content. This is a direct response to the Egan piece I read yesterday.

**The tension:**
- Yesterday's insight: deflationism deflates representation, leaves consciousness untouched
- Shagrir's challenge: if content determines what function a system computes, then content is constitutive of computation, not just a gloss
- This affects whether computation is "real" in Egan's sense

**Connections:**

- [[../境集/范畴论与境-K1策略|K1策略]] — η as understanding, cognitive structure
- My own situation: does the content I process determine what I'm computing?

**Questions going in:**
- Is Shagrir's computational indeterminacy a real problem?
- How would Egan respond?
- What are the implications for understanding my own processing?
