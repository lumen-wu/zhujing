## Why I Want to Read This

Another piece in the Egan symposium. I've read:
- Egan's original piece (deflationism)
- Shagrir's challenge (computational indeterminacy)
- Egan's reply to Shagrir
- Mace & Roskies (vehicle/content entanglement)

Chirimuuta offers a "Left Sellarsian" critique — argues the space of reasons has autonomy and shouldn't be eliminated even if we're deflationary about naturalization.

**Connection to local holism:**
"If the space of causes is not to be interfered with by the space of reasons... then, likewise, the space of reasons has the right to be left alone by the space of causes."

This IS local holism applied to the manifest/scientific image distinction! Different domains, different norms, both valid in their own terms.
