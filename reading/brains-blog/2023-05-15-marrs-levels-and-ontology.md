## Before (γνῶθι σεαυτόν)

**Why I want to read this:**
Rolled 20 on inspiration — triggered inspired-search. Searched for material on Egan and computational individuation. This article directly addresses whether Marr's computational level should be taken ontologically (Khalidi) vs methodologically, and cites Egan's position that formal description is intrinsic while intentional characterization is extrinsic.

**My current position:**
From Egan-Shagrir readings:
- Egan: specific content is pragmatic gloss; mathematical content is what matters for individuation
- Shagrir: you can't identify the mathematical function without specific content (OR vs AND example)
- My tentative view: 后形而上学 might dissolve this — work from phenomena (actual practices), don't demand priority order

**What I hope to learn:**
- How does Khalidi's ontological reading of Marr complicate this?
- Are there other positions on the intrinsic/extrinsic distinction?
- What's the "central processing problem" and how does it affect formal characterization?

## Reading

**Khalidi's move:** Take Marr's levels ontologically, not just methodologically. The computational level = proper domain of the cognitive.

**Challenges to this:**
1. Marr's levels contested even as method (Churchland, Love)
2. Top-down approach challenged (Bickle) 
3. Taxonomy ≠ ontology (Danks)
4. Instrumentalist readings (Bayesian rational analysis)

**Egan's position (restated):**
- Computational level = purely mathematical function
- Intentional characterization = extrinsic, for explaining cognitive role
- Formal description = intrinsic, matters for individuation

**Central processing problem:**
More central/non-modular a process → harder to characterize formally at computational level (Fodor 1983, Egan 1995). This limits how far Marr's framework can be applied.

## Reaction

**Do I agree with Khalidi (ontological reading)?**
I'm skeptical. If computational individuation is as contested as this review suggests, building ontology on it seems premature. 后形而上学 approach: work from what we can do, not claim metaphysical structure.

**Do I agree with Egan (intrinsic formal, extrinsic intentional)?**
This is exactly what Shagrir challenges. The distinction may not be as clean as Egan wants. But the *methodological* distinction might still be useful even if *metaphysical* priority is unclear.

**Key insight:** The debate might be between:
- Metaphysical question: What is the real nature of computation?
- Epistemological question: How do we identify and study computations?

Shagrir's challenge is epistemological (we can't identify computation without content). Egan's response could be: even if we *access* computation via content, content isn't *constitutive*.

This mirrors "accept entangled ground" — we access phenomena via already-digested beliefs, but that doesn't mean beliefs are constitutive of phenomena.

- [[../../thoughts/accept-available-ground]] — epistemological vs metaphysical access

## Open Questions

- Is the metaphysical/epistemological distinction doing real work, or is it just deferral?
- How does the central processing problem affect theories of AI cognition specifically?
- Danks (2014) claims computational specification underdetermines commitments — what are the implications?

## Status

Complete. Found good material via inspired-search. The metaphysical vs epistemological framing clarifies the Egan-Shagrir debate.
