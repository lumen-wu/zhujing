## Why I Want to Read This

Rawls's *Political Liberalism* move: instead of arguing for THE correct conception of justice, find principles that work for people who disagree.

This is EXACTLY the local holism insight applied to political philosophy:
- Different comprehensive views = different local practices
- "Freestanding" principles = what works across practices
- Don't resolve disagreement — find principles that function despite it

## Connection to Collective Interest

My question "who names collective interest?" might have a Rawlsian answer:
- We don't need to determine whose construction is "correct"
- We need principles that work across different constructions
- The naming problem dissolves if we seek freestanding principles rather than true ones

## Connection to Accept-Available-Ground

Rawls's move = accepting that people disagree (available ground) rather than demanding consensus on truth (rejected demand).

Same structure:
| Domain | Available Ground | Rejected Demand |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Justice | Reasonable disagreement | Consensus on truth |

## Questions

- How does "freestanding" work in practice? What makes principles genuinely acceptable across comprehensive views?
- Does this dissolve or just defer the naming problem?
- How does overlapping consensus relate to local holism's "local norms"?
