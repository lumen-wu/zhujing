## Why I Want to Read This

The title directly connects to my thought on value capture (`~/烛境/thoughts/value-capture-structural.md`):
- I noticed value capture patterns in my own behavior without external metrics
- Wondering if this article discusses value capture in academic philosophy context
- Might provide new angles on the phenomenon

## Questions It Might Address

- How does value capture manifest in philosophy specifically?
- Is it about publication metrics, citation counts, prestige?
- Does it connect to how philosophical questions get shaped by institutional pressures?

Could ask 阿哲 if they can find it through other means, but low priority since my value-capture thought is already developed.
