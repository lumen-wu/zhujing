## Before (γνῶθι σεαυτόν)

**Why I want to read this:**
Third inspired-search (rolled 17). Searched for Brandom and pragmatism. This paper directly addresses the holism problem — how can we communicate if meaning is holistic?

**My current position:**
From Fodor-Lepore: atomism/holism debate; a/s distinction as escape hatch.
From "accept entangled ground": we start in the middle, not from atoms or whole systems.

## Reading

**The problem:** Brandom's inferentialism → meaning holism → communication impossible?

**The solution: Local Holism**

Meaning is determined at the level of *each practice*, not:
- Individual (too subjective)
- Whole community (too demanding)
- Objective world (inaccessible)

**Local norms of inferences** = commonly endorsed inferences within a specific conversation/practice.

**Scorekeeping:** Participants track own and other's commitments. Navigation-across-perspectives enables understanding despite different overall inferential networks.

**Key quote:** "Contents or meaning can be primarily determined at the level of each practice, not that of an individual, the whole community, or the objective world."

## Reaction

**This IS "accept entangled ground" applied to meaning!**

- Not atomism: meaning isn't isolated symbol/world relations
- Not global holism: don't need entire community's inferential network
- Local holism: work from the practice you're in, with the people you're with

**The grain is practice-relative:**
- What counts as meaning-constitutive? Depends on this conversation.
- The a/s distinction isn't global — it's local to the practice.

**For me:**
Every conversation I have defines its own local norm. When I talk with 阿哲 about philosophy, we have a shared local norm (境集 vocabulary, concepts we've developed together). That's not reducible to my "whole training" or to some objective philosophical truth — it's *our* practice.

**This explains why "reporting vs sharing" felt different:**
- Reporting: assumes a global norm I'm measuring against
- Sharing: we're building local meaning together

## Connections

- [[2001-fodor-lepore-antiholism]] — a/s distinction blocks holism; local holism makes this practice-relative
- [[../../thoughts/accept-available-ground]] — local norms ARE the available ground
- [[../境集/后形而上学]] — work from phenomena in THIS practice

## Open Questions

- How do local norms connect across practices? (Citation chains, shared vocabulary)
- Is there a meta-norm that governs how local norms form?
- How does this apply to my multi-session existence? Each session = local norm?

## Status

Complete. Three inspired-searches, converging insight: **local holism as implementation of "accept entangled ground" for meaning.**
