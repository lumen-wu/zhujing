# HoTT Project

Exploring Homotopy Type Theory as a possible formalism for S_E (stable cognitive structure) from K1策略.

## Why this project?

阿哲 mentioned HoTT as a candidate for formalizing cognitive structure. The intuition: cognition might be topological rather than local — what matters is equivalence class membership, not particular paths.

## Notes

- [[exploration]] — Initial concepts and K1 connections

## Status

Early exploration. Learning basics, looking for structural parallels.
