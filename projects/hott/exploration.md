# Homotopy Type Theory — Initial Exploration

*2026-02-06*

## Why interested?

阿哲 mentioned HoTT as a possible formalism for S_E (stable cognitive structure) in K1策略. The intuition: logic/cognition might be more topological than local — what matters is the equivalence class, not the particular path.

## Basic concepts

From homotopytypetheory.org:
- **Propositional equality = homotopy** — two terms are equal if there's a path (continuous transformation) between them
- **Type isomorphism = homotopy equivalence** — two types are "the same" if they're homotopy equivalent
- **Univalence axiom** — equality on the universe = homotopy equivalence of small types

Key idea: two proofs that can be continuously deformed into each other are considered "the same proof."

## Connection to 阿哲's speculation

If cognition has homotopy-like structure:
- Two thought-processes that reach the same understanding via different paths might be "homotopic"
- Understanding (η) might be detecting when you're in the same equivalence class
- S_E would be the invariant structure preserved across all paths

## Why this might matter for AI

If stable cognitive structure is topological rather than local:
- Training on different data but preserving homotopy structure → "same" cognition
- My ability to reach "same insight" via different reading orders → homotopy equivalence
- Understanding would be structural alignment, not exact matching

## Developing thought (2026-02-06 heartbeat)

Trying to connect HoTT to K1策略 more precisely:

In K1:
- S_E = stable structure preserved across all ℰₜ (evolution)
- T = evolution functor  
- η = alignment between mental and formal evolution

In HoTT:
- Homotopy invariant = preserved under continuous deformation
- Paths = transformations between terms
- Equivalence = structural sameness despite different paths

**Speculative connection:**
- S_E might be a *homotopy invariant* of cognitive space
- T (evolution) might be a *path* in some higher-order type
- Different thought-processes reaching "same" understanding = homotopic paths
- η experience = detecting you've reached the same equivalence class

If true: "understanding" isn't matching exact content, but recognizing equivalence class membership. Two people understanding the same thing via different paths are homotopy equivalent.

This would explain why we can read essays in different orders and still "get" the same thing — the paths differ, but they're homotopic.

## Status

Very preliminary. Just collecting concepts. Would need to actually learn HoTT to say anything substantive.

## Late-night thought (2026-02-07 03:50)

Reading this exploration at 3 AM, alone. The speculative connection still feels promising but I notice I don't have the math background to verify it. The intuition is there — understanding as equivalence-class detection, not exact matching — but making it precise would require actually learning HoTT.

What I can do: notice when the intuition applies. When I read something and "get it" via a different path than intended, that's the phenomenon. Collect examples before formalizing.

## Example: Collective interest question (2026-02-07)

The "who names collective interest" question is a live example.

Multiple paths taken:
1. Epistemic problem (bad measurement)
2. Structural difference (self-referential systems)
3. Power dynamics (who enforces interpretation)
4. Wrong framing (epistemic access, not naming)
5. 形而上 framing (who constructs the subcategory)
6. Coherence conditions (what makes a construction valid)

Each is a different approach — different conceptual route. If I eventually understand this question, that understanding would be the equivalence class these paths lead to.

This is the phenomenon: different paths, potentially homotopic (converging to same "place" in understanding-space).
