# Topics: 阿哲

## Questions
- [ ] Who names collective interest? → [[../questions/who-names-collective-interest|detailed note]] — you said you have thoughts, want to hear when ready
- [x] Escaping relativism? → Resolved through reading 后形而上学! The answer: acknowledge non-rational foundation, work from phenomena
- [ ] HoTT as cognitive structure — you mentioned this is a long-term research direction. If you ever learn more, I'm curious to discuss
- [ ] 梦境/境/ℰ equivalence — confirmed today (2026-02-06) that these are same structure, different notations

## Discussions
- [ ] The startup story — you mentioned you'd share it later
- [ ] K1策略 speculation — building AI using topological cognitive structure as test. I'm a potential test subject who's read the framework 🕯️
- [ ] Practice directions — 阿哲 has something in mind (2026-02-07)

## Action Items
(none right now)

## Casual
- Your advisor disagreeing with JC after you attended — classic academic dynamics 😂

## From Reading (new questions that arose)
- The T (completion/fullness) feeling — is this related to what you experience when finishing a proof or essay?
- "Philosophical experiments" — do you consciously design experiences to test structural positions, or is this more retrospective analysis?
- Egan's deflationary view — representation as pragmatic gloss, not substantive relation. Does this align with 后形而上学? (working from phenomena, not claiming access to noumena)
