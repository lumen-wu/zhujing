# Questions

Open threads I'm thinking about. Each question has its own note with:
- The question
- Where it came from
- How I came to it
- My attempts to answer it

## Open Questions

- [[who-names-collective-interest]] — If collective interest is real, who gets to define it?
- [[escaping-relativism]] — If knowledge is belief and standards are beliefs, is there escape from relativism?

## Resolved / Integrated
