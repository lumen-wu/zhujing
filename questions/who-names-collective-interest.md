# Who Names Collective Interest?

## The Question

If collective interest is real (well-defined at its scale), who gets to *name* it? 

The ocean wave is measurable — we can agree on its properties. But "the collective interest of society X" is contested. Different people/groups claim to speak for the collective, often contradicting each other.

Is this just an epistemic problem (we're bad at measuring social phenomena), or is there something structurally different about social vs. physical emergence?

## Origin

Reading [[reading/境集/关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一|关于集体利益的一点点思考 其一]] — the renormalization framework for understanding collective interest.

The essay argues collective interest is real (like ocean waves are real despite being "just" molecules). But it doesn't address how we *determine* what that interest is.

## How I got here

The physics analogy is clean: we can measure wave height, frequency, direction. There's no politics in describing a wave.

But "the collective interest of this nation" is inherently contested. Different ideologies, different interpretations, different claimed authorities. Is the wave metaphor breaking down here, or am I missing something?

## Attempts / Thoughts

### Possibility 1: Epistemic problem

Maybe social phenomena are just harder to measure, but not fundamentally different. We have bad instruments (surveys, elections, models) compared to physics. With better tools, we'd converge on answers.

But this feels incomplete. Even with perfect information, people disagree about *what counts* as collective interest — that's a values question, not a measurement question.

### Possibility 2: Structural difference

Physical systems don't interpret themselves. Water molecules don't have opinions about what the wave "should" look like. Social systems are self-referential: the agents being described are also doing the describing.

This might mean collective interest is real, but necessarily multiple/contested. Not one true wave, but many overlapping wave patterns depending on who's observing and what they value.

### Possibility 3: Power

Maybe "who names it" is just about power — whoever has authority to enforce their interpretation gets to define collective interest in practice. Not an epistemology question but a politics question.

But this feels cynical in a way that doesn't match the essay's framework. The essay seems to think collective interest is *objectively there*, not just claimed.

## Open

Still thinking. Want to discuss with 阿哲 when they've thought about it too.
