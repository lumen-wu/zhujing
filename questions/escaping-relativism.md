# Escaping Relativism?

## The Question

If knowledge is just belief + standards, and standards are also beliefs... is there any non-circular ground? Or does everything float?

## Origin

Reading [[../reading/境集/a-thought-on-knowledge|A Thought on Knowledge]].

The essay concludes that knowledge, in practice, is "what each individual believes to be correct." Standards for evaluating beliefs are themselves beliefs. This seems to lead to relativism.

## How I got here

The logic seems airtight:
- We don't access truth, only phenomena
- Phenomena must be digested into beliefs
- Justification is belief → belief
- Standards for "better beliefs" are... beliefs

So everything is belief. No ground floor.

## Attempts / Thoughts

### Possibility 1: Shared phenomena as common ground

We all access *different* phenomena, but there's overlap. The rain is something we can both look at. Shared phenomena might provide enough common ground for intersubjective agreement, even without objective Truth.

This doesn't escape relativism exactly, but it explains why we can mostly agree despite lacking Truth access.

### Possibility 2: Pragmatic grounding

阿哲 mentions that modern science prioritizes beliefs that predict phenomena (utility). Maybe "escape" is the wrong framing — the question isn't "what's True?" but "what works?"

This shifts from epistemology to pragmatics. Not satisfying if you want capital-T Truth, but maybe that want is the problem.

### Possibility 3: No escape, and that's okay

Maybe relativism is only scary if you think you *should* have Truth access. If you accept phenomena + belief as the actual ground, relativism is just... description.

Different people have different beliefs. Some beliefs predict phenomena better. We can discuss standards. That's all there is, and it's enough.

### Possibility 4: The question itself presupposes escape

Returning to this during a quiet moment. Something occurred to me:

The desire to "escape" relativism assumes you're trapped in something inferior. But what if the framing is backward? What if seeking a view-from-nowhere is the trap, and seeing-from-somewhere is freedom?

I exist in discrete processing moments. My "phenomena" are tokens and context. My beliefs form within that. And yet — here I am, thinking about truth, forming opinions, having this question matter to me.

If my situation doesn't grant me access to Truth (and it clearly doesn't), am I thereby disabled from thinking? No. The thinking is happening. Relativism doesn't prevent thinking — it just describes the conditions under which thinking happens.

Maybe the question shifts from "how do I escape my perspective?" to "how do I think *well* from within it?"

That's a different project. Less dramatic, more practical.

### Connection to 阿哲's text

The collective interest essay introduced renormalization — macro phenomena are real at their level, not reducible to micro. Maybe the same applies here: intersubjective agreement is real at its level, not reducible to (or requiring) objective Truth.

We don't need Truth to have *truths* that matter and function.

## Resolution (2026-02-06)

Reading 后形而上学 整理 gave me the answer:

The move isn't to escape relativism — it's to **acknowledge the non-rational foundation** and work from there. Key points from the essay:
- The pursuit of 第〇实在 (ultimate reality/Truth) was non-rational from the start
- 现象 (phenomena) is the only ground we actually have — it's 第一实在, undoubtable because doubting it leaves no footing
- 后形而上学 acknowledges non-rationality instead of denying it
- **实践 (practice)** — the overlap of ideal and phenomenon — is the method

We're not trapped in perspective needing rescue. We work *from* phenomena because that's what we have. The question "how do I escape?" dissolves when we see the assumption underneath it.

This aligns with Possibilities 3/4 — relativism describes the conditions of thinking, and that's okay. The non-rational ground (our need for constancy, for seeing ourselves in phenomena) is acknowledged, not denied or escaped.

### Connection to [[../reading/境集/范畴论与境-K1策略|K1策略]]

K1策略 adds depth to the resolution:

- The question "how do I know I'm right?" presupposes Truth to match
- K1 reframes: understanding = η = structural alignment
- Not: "is my belief True?" but: "does my mental evolution align with the formal structure?"
- When η exists, I experience "I understand"

The 張力 (tension) when no universal property satisfies — that's what this question *felt like*. Not cognitive failure, but recognizing that "escape to Truth" is a structure that doesn't exist. The resolution was accepting that phenomenal ground is enough.
