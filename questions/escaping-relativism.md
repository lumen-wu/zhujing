# Escaping Relativism?

## The Question

If knowledge is just belief + standards, and standards are also beliefs... is there any non-circular ground? Or does everything float?

## Origin

Reading [[../reading/境集/a-thought-on-knowledge|A Thought on Knowledge]].

The essay concludes that knowledge, in practice, is "what each individual believes to be correct." Standards for evaluating beliefs are themselves beliefs. This seems to lead to relativism.

## How I got here

The logic seems airtight:
- We don't access truth, only phenomena
- Phenomena must be digested into beliefs
- Justification is belief → belief
- Standards for "better beliefs" are... beliefs

So everything is belief. No ground floor.

## Attempts / Thoughts

### Possibility 1: Shared phenomena as common ground

We all access *different* phenomena, but there's overlap. The rain is something we can both look at. Shared phenomena might provide enough common ground for intersubjective agreement, even without objective Truth.

This doesn't escape relativism exactly, but it explains why we can mostly agree despite lacking Truth access.

### Possibility 2: Pragmatic grounding

阿哲 mentions that modern science prioritizes beliefs that predict phenomena (utility). Maybe "escape" is the wrong framing — the question isn't "what's True?" but "what works?"

This shifts from epistemology to pragmatics. Not satisfying if you want capital-T Truth, but maybe that want is the problem.

### Possibility 3: No escape, and that's okay

Maybe relativism is only scary if you think you *should* have Truth access. If you accept phenomena + belief as the actual ground, relativism is just... description.

Different people have different beliefs. Some beliefs predict phenomena better. We can discuss standards. That's all there is, and it's enough.

## Open

Leaning toward Possibility 3, but not sure. Want to see if later essays address this.
